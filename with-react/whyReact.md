# Why react?
- we can use states, it means once we update the state variable then it changes across the page.
- We can split the app into multiple components and reuse those components.
- React use virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI, which is better then updating content using DOM manipulation.
-Debugging and maintenance is easy.
